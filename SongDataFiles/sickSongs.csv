I don't have songs I'm sick of
"I have some that I enjoyed a lot, but I don't as much anymore"
"but none that I'm sick of (still you forced me to write something down here, so here you go, make wrong assumptions, get wrong data)"

i'm very careful not too listen to songs too often to prevent this from happening
"well, it sometimes happens that i'm kind of over an album or a whole artist/band an stop listening to it/them for a while, this happend a while ago with the band TR/ST, but they are back in my playlist again. but i don't really get ""sick"" of music i like, just of music i didn't especially like in the first place (but still had to listen to for some reason)"
